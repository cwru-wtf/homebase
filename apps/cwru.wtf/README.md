## What is cwru.wtf?

This isn't a club where we talk about doing things—it's where we **actually do them**. We build hardware hacks, AI experiments, large-scale art, films, open-source tools, weird websites, and games. Anything that makes you say "wtf, I wanna try that."

### What We Do

- **Build Anything** — Hardware, AI, art, films, open-source tools, weird websites, game dev
- **Learn by Doing** — No experience required. Just curiosity and a willingness to build
- **Ship It** — Late-night build sessions, mentorship, and collaborative projects

### Featured Projects

- **FPGA Multilayer Perceptron** — Custom "AI" on custom hardware
- **CWRU Games** — Games by CWRU students, for CWRU students ([games.cwru.wtf](https://games.cwru.wtf))
- **WTF Supercomputer** — Distributed compute cluster from donated student machines
- **Interactive Art** — Environmental-responsive art installations
